# commons (development version)

* `commons()` gains a `mode` argument. With `mode = "trusted only"`, the agent answers only with trusted calculations. It never writes its own SQL or R, and it tells the user when no trusted calculation answers a question. These answers carry no provenance markers.

# commons 0.1.1

* Fixes an issue with the R code sandbox where the generated policy would be
  too long when there were thousands of R packages installed.

* A number of improvements to documentation.

# commons 0.1.0

* Initial release.
